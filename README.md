# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Features
User Metrics Overview: Displays total users, premium users, subscriptions, active users, new registrations, and total received reports.
Data Visualization: Integrates Recharts for visual representation of data, including a pie chart for gender distribution.
Modern UI Components: Utilizes Material-UI for a consistent and professional look and feel across the dashboard.
